Introduction
Bazaar plugin for CruiseControl.NET. You can use it to define a cc.net sourcecontrol task compatible with bzr. The history is parsed as with other VCS.

Details
To use the Bazaar plugin for CruiseControl?.NET, copy the ccnet.bzr.plugin.dll file into the directory that the other CruiseControl.NET DLLs are in, and add a project to your ccnet.config that uses Bazaar. See the ccnet.config.sample file for an example of which fields you should add to the project's configuration.

sample:

<sourcecontrol type="bzr">
  <branchUrl>http://build/repo/myproject/trunk</branchUrl>
  <workingDirectory>/tmp</workingDirectory>
  <executable>bzr</executable>
</sourcecontrol>
